# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

I knew about the effect that the emotional body has on the physical body, both beneficial as well as negative. But I knew little about the effect that the physical body can have on the mental and emotional bodies. I realized that the physical balance techniques helped me stabilize emotionally.</p> <p>I learned how to use breath control to calm down or to energize myself. The body awareness I gained helped me to identify the causes of physical imbalances and avoid them.
