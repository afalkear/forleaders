I knew about the effect that the emotional body has on the physical body, both beneficial as well as negative. But I knew little about the effect that the physical body can have on the mental and emotional bodies. I realized that the physical balance techniques helped me stabilize emotionally.</p> <p>I learned how to use breath control to calm down or to energize myself. The body awareness I gained helped me to identify the causes of physical imbalances and avoid them. Besides these, there are many other minor benefits which together improved my overall quality of life.</p>"
